# Minimal Example on Multi-Versioned Python Package Management

This is a minimal (and currently incomplete) example on how to develop, build, package, and test a project that _requires_ python 2.7 support.

This specifically attempts to adopt modern tools from python 3.10, and bolt on 2.7 support.

If you are in this situation, I do not envy you.
